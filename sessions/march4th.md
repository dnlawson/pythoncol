# Playing Around With Loops

## Program: Guess the Number

- Write a program that asks the user guess what number the computer is thinking of. After each guess, the program will tell the user whether the guess was too high or too low. If the user guesses correctly, the program congratulates the user and tells them how many guesses it took. If the user does not guess correctly within six guesses, end the program and print the correct number.

- The output of the program should look like this:

  ```
  I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
  Take a guess.
  10
  Your guess is too low.
  Take a guess.
  15
  Your guess is too low.
  Take a guess.
  17
  Your guess is too high.
  Take a guess.
  16
  Good job! You guessed my number in 4 guesses!
  ```

## Program: Rock, Paper, Scissors

- Write a program that plays a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user and keeps track of the number of wins, losses, and ties. 

- The output of the program should look like this:

```
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
0 Wins, 0 Losses, 0 Ties
Enter your move: (r)ock (p)aper (s)cissors or (q)uit
p
PAPER versus...
PAPER
It is a tie!
0 Wins, 1 Losses, 1 Ties
Enter your move: (r)ock (p)aper (s)cissors or (q)uit
s
SCISSORS versus...
PAPER
You win!
1 Wins, 1 Losses, 1 Ties
Enter your move: (r)ock (p)aper (s)cissors or (q)uit
q
```
