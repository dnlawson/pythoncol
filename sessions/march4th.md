# Playing Around With Loops

## Program: Guess the Number

- Write a program that asks the user guess what number the computer is thinking of. After each guess, the program will tell the user whether the guess was too high or too low. If the user guesses correctly, the program congratulates the user and tells them how many guesses it took. If the user does not guess correctly within six guesses, end the program and print the correct number.
