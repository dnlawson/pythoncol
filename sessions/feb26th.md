# February 26th, 2020 - Flow Control (Ch. 2 of Automate the Boring Stuff) and Python from the Command Line

## [Programming Python From the Command Line](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html)

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Make sure that it recognizes Python by typing py
3. Type in a simple command to make sure that you are in the interactive shell
4. Run the program by typing py followed by the script path

## Boolean Values

- **Boolean Values** evaluate to either True or False

## Comparison Operators 

- **Comparison Operators** compare two values and evaluate down to a Boolean value

## Boolean Operators

- There are three **Boolean Operators**: **and**, **or**, and **not**

### Binary Boolean Operators

- **and** and **or** are **binary Boolean operators** because they compare two Boolean values
- The **and** operators evaluates to True if both Boolean values are True; otherwise, it evaluates to False
- The **or** operator evalutes to True if one of the Boolean values is True. It evalutes to False if both the Boolean values are False. 

### The not Operator

- The **not** operator is a **unary operator** because it takes only one Boolean value. It evalues to the opposite of the Boolean value which it takes. 

## Elements of Flow Control

### Conditions

- **Conditions** always evaluate down to a Boolean value. A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its conditions are True or False, and almost every flow control statements uses a condition. 

### Blocks of Code

- Lines of Python code can be grouped together in **blocks**
- Rules for blocks:
        1.
