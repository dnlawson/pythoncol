# February 19th, 2020 - Python Basics (Ch. 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff)

## Entering expressions

- **Expressions** are made up of **values** and **operators** (ex. 2 + 2) and reduce to a single value
- Python (and computers in general) are very good at evaluating expressions!
- Python follows PEMDAS

## Data types

- Three main types: **integers (2, 30)**, **floats (decimals)**, and **strings (cats, 11 dogs)**
- Strings are put in quotes

## String concatenation and replication

### String concatenation

- Use the '+' operator to smash two strings together (ex. "straw" + "berry")
- The data types must both be strings

### String replication

- Use the * to repeat a string a certain number of times (ex. "dog" * 5)
- Data types must both be numeric values or one string value and one integer value

## Storing values in variables

### Assignment Statements

- An **assignment statement** stores values in variables
- Variables can be **overwritten**

## Project!!!

Write a program that asks the user for their name and age. The program should then calculate how old the user will be in one year and print the answer.
