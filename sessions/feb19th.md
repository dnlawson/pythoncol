# February 19th, 2020 - Python Basics (Ch. 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff)

## Entering expressions

- Expressions are made up of values and operators (ex. 2 + 2) and reduce to a single value
- Python (and computers in general) are very good at evaluating expressions!
- Python follows PEMDAS

## Data types

- Three main types: integers (2, 30), floats (decimals), and strings (cats, 11 dogs)
- Strings are put in quotes

## String concatenation and replication

### String concatenation

- Use the '+' operator to smash two strings together (ex. "straw" + "berry")
- The data types MUST both be strings

### String replication

## Storing values in variables

## Project!!!
