# February 19th, 2020 - Python Basics (Ch. 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff)

## Entering expressions

- **Expressions** are made up of **values** and **operators** (ex. 2 + 2) and reduce to a single value
- Python (and computers in general) are very good at evaluating expressions!
- Python follows PEMDAS

## Data types

- Three main types: **integers (2, 30)**, **floats (decimals)**, and **strings (cats, 11 dogs)**
- Strings are put in quotes

## String concatenation and replication

### String concatenation

- Use the '+' operator to smash two strings together (ex. "straw" + "berry")
- The data types must both be strings

### String replication

- Use the * to repeat a string a certain number of times (ex. "dog" * 5)
- Data types must both be numeric values or one string value and one integer value

## Storing values in variables

### Assignment Statements

- An **assignment statement** stores values in variables
- Variables can be **overwritten**

## Built in functions

- One of the nice things about Python is that it has lots of built in functions that you can call on while building your programs, as opposed to programming languages like C++ where you have to write all your own functions

### The print() function

- The print function will display the string on the screen
- ex. print("Hello, world")

### The input() function

- This functions allows the user to input a value from the keyboard; this value can then be assigned to a variable
- ex. starsign = input()

### The len() function

- Evaluates how long a string is
- ex. len("Devin")

### str(), int(), and float() functions

- Convert one data type into another (ex. float to string)
- ex. str(42.0)

## Project!!!

Write a program that asks the user for their name, greets the user by name, and then calculates the length of the user's name. The program should then ask the user for their age, calculate how old the user will be in one year, and print the answer as a string. Compare your program with the program in the textbook. What differences are there? Are there any questions or improvements you would make to either program?
